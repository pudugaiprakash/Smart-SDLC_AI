SmartSDLC – AI-Enhanced Software Development Lifecycle
SmartSDLC is a full-stack, AI-driven platform designed to streamline and automate key phases of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). By leveraging state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) and generative AI, SmartSDLC bridges the gap between unstructured inputs and structured development workflows, making software creation faster, smarter, and more efficient.

🔍 Overview
Traditional SDLC processes involve a high degree of manual effort across requirement analysis, code development, testing, and documentation. SmartSDLC addresses this inefficiency by introducing intelligent automation across six major scenarios:

Requirement Classification
Code Generation
Bug Detection and Fixing
Test Case Generation
Code Summarization
AI Chatbot Assistant
✨ Features
📄 Requirement Classifier
Upload PDFs containing unstructured requirements. The AI model automatically classifies each sentence into SDLC phases—Requirements, Design, Development, Testing, or Deployment.

💡 AI Code Generator
Convert user stories or prompts into production-ready Python code using IBM Watsonx’s generative model.

🐞 Bug Fixer
Paste buggy code, and the AI analyzes and corrects both syntactical and logical errors with explanations.

🧪 Test Case Generator
Generate unit tests using popular Python testing frameworks like pytest or unittest, based on code or plain text requirements.

📘 Code Summarizer
Submit any Python code snippet and receive a detailed summary explaining its logic, functions, and usage.

🤖 SDLC Chatbot
An integrated floating chatbot assistant to answer queries related to software development concepts and best practices.
